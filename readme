Responsive Design
The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops. I’ve used CSS3 media queries to ensure an optimal viewing experience for all users.

Dynamic Interaction with JavaScript
JavaScript adds dynamic interactivity, improving the user experience. Whether it’s smooth scrolling, interactive forms, or real-time content updates, I’ve leveraged the power of vanilla JavaScript to create a fluid and engaging interface.

Clean and Modern UI
The design focuses on simplicity and usability. With a minimalist approach, the layout emphasizes the content without unnecessary distractions. CSS3 animations and transitions add subtle visual effects to enhance the overall aesthetics.

Project Showcase
The portfolio highlights my completed and ongoing projects, with detailed descriptions, technologies used, and live demos or GitHub links. Each project page is carefully structured for easy navigation and comprehension.

Contact Form
A simple, user-friendly contact form is included to facilitate communication. It validates input fields using JavaScript to ensure seamless communication between visitors and myself.
